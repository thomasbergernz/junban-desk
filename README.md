# Junban Desk

A custom queue workspace for Jira Service Management, built on [Atlassian Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/).

Junban Desk replaces the default JSM queue views with a single, focused agent workspace:

- **"Needs action" queue** — every open ticket that is not waiting on the customer, oldest first
- **Filters** — All / Unassigned / Assigned to me (remembered across reloads)
- **Inline ticket detail** — collapsible description and the full comment thread, with internal notes clearly marked
- **Reply without leaving the queue** — customer reply or internal note, with a Zendesk-style status-at-submit dropdown
- **Assignment** — assign to yourself or others directly from the detail pane
- **Auto-refresh** — the queue polls in the background, pausing while the tab is hidden

The frontend is Forge Custom UI (React + Vite in a sandboxed iframe). The backend is a set of
Forge resolvers calling the Jira REST API as the logged-in agent, so Jira's own permission
checks always apply.

The easiest way to use Junban Desk is the Atlassian Marketplace listing (paid, per user).
The instructions below are for running your own copy from source.

## Project layout

```
manifest.yml.example   Forge manifest template (copy to manifest.yml)
src/resolvers/         Backend resolvers (queue, ticket, reply, assign)
static/queue/          Custom UI frontend (React + Vite)
```

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js 22.x or 24.x LTS and the [Forge CLI](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/getting-started/) (`npm install -g @forge/cli`, then `forge login`).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (root + frontend)
npm install
npm --prefix static/queue install

# 2. Create your manifest and register your own app id
cp manifest.yml.example manifest.yml
forge register

# 3. Build the frontend, then deploy and install
npm run build:queue
forge deploy -e development
forge install   # choose Jira and your site
```

The app appears as **Junban Desk** in the sidebar of your JSM project.

### Development loop

- Backend (resolver) changes: `forge tunnel` hot-reloads them.
- Frontend changes: re-run `npm run build:queue`, then refresh (no hot reload for Custom UI).
- Manifest changes: redeploy; scope changes also need `forge install --upgrade`.
